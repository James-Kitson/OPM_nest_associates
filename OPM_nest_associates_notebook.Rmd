#OPM Sanger processing

###This [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) notebook has been written to outline the steps taken to quality trim and merge sanger sequences for OAK Processionary Moth nest associates. 

##Part one - Set up the libraries we need.
We're going to be using a library called [sangeranalyseR](https://github.com/roblanf/sangeranalyseR) so that the process is more documented and reproducible compared to the usual trimming and mergeing by eye performed using Geneious, FinchTV or similar programs. There are quite a few required libraries here but a script called [installs_for_sangerseqR.R](https://github.com/James-Kitson/OPM_nest_associates/blob/master/installs_for_sangerseqR.R) contains all the relevant commands.

```{r}
#Load the library we need
library(sangerseqR)
```
