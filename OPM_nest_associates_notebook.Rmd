#OPM Sanger processing

###This [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) notebook has been written to outline the steps taken to quality trim and merge sanger sequences for OAK Processionary Moth nest associates. 

##Part one - Set up the libraries we need.
We're going to be using a library called [sangeranalyseR](https://github.com/roblanf/sangeranalyseR) so that the process is more documented and reproducible compared to the sual trimming and mergeing by eye performed using Geneious, FinchTV and similar programs.
